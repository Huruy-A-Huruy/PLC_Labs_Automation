# PLC Automation Labs

This repository contains Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) labs completed as part of my Electrical Engineering Technician program.  
The labs were implemented using Rockwell Logix Designer and demonstrate ladder logic programming for automation tasks.

## 📂 Contents
- **Lab 4A – Increment/Decrement Control**
  - Implements push-button based voltage adjustment.
  - Includes one-shot rising instructions (ONS) to allow controlled increments and decrements.
  - Demonstrates use of `MOV`, `ADD`, and `SUB` instructions.
  
- **Lab 4B – Temperature Control & Timers**
  - Calculates upper and lower thresholds based on setpoint and deadband.
  - Compares real-time temperature input to thresholds.
  - Activates lamps when temperature exceeds or falls below limits.
  - Uses a retentive timer (RTO) to measure lamp ON time.
  - Provides reset functionality with a push button.
